Software engineering has a great solution to reduce the complication of any project. Software engineering divides big problems into various small issues. And then start solving each small issue one by one. All these small problems are solved independently to each other.<\/li><li><strong>To minimize software cost:<\/strong>\u00a0Software needs a lot of hardwork and software engineers are highly paid experts. A lot of manpower is required to develop software with a large number of codes. But in software engineering, programmers project everything and decrease all those things that are not needed. In turn, the cost for software productions becomes less as compared to any software that does not use software engineering method.<\/li><li><strong>To decrease time:<\/strong>\u00a0Anything that is not made according to the project always wastes time. And if you are making great software, then you may need to run many codes to get the definitive running code. This is a very time-consuming procedure, and if it is not well handled, then this can take a lot of time. So if you are making your software according to the software engineering method, then it will decrease a lot of time.<\/li><li><strong>Handling big projects:<\/strong>\u00a0Big projects are not done in a couple of days, and they need lots of patience, planning, and management. And to invest six and seven months of any company, it requires heaps of planning, direction, testing, and maintenance. No one can say that he has given four months of a company to the task, and the project is still in its first stage. Because the company has provided many resources to the plan and it should be completed. So to handle a big project without any problem, the company has to go for a software engineering method.<\/li><li><strong>Reliable software:<\/strong>\u00a0Software should be secure, means if you have delivered the software, then it should work for at least its given time or subscription. And if any bugs come in the software, the company is responsible for solving all these bugs. Because in software engineering, testing and maintenance are given, so there is no worry of its reliability.<\/li><li><strong>Effectiveness:<\/strong>\u00a0Effectiveness comes if anything has made according to the standards. Software standards are the big target of companies to make it more effective. So Software becomes more effective in the act with the help of software engineering.<\/li><\/ol><h2 class=\"h1\">Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):<\/h2><p>A software life cycle model (also termed process model) is a pictorial and diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle. A life cycle model represents all the methods required to make a software product transit through its life cycle stages. It also captures the structure in which these methods are to be undertaken.<\/p><p>In other words, a life cycle model maps the various activities performed on a software product from its inception to retirement. Different life cycle models may plan the necessary development activities to phases in different ways. Thus, no element which life cycle model is followed, the essential activities are contained in all life cycle models though the action may be carried out in distinct orders in different life cycle models. During any life cycle stage, more than one activity may also be carried out.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1790ebf elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"1790ebf\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"298\" height=\"300\" src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wordpress\/softwareengineeringnotes\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/02\/SDLC_-_Software_Development_Life_Cycle.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1ef9b62 elementor-widget elementor-widget-spacer\" data-id=\"1ef9b62\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"spacer.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer-inner\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-ed49c4a elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"ed49c4a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-large\">Software Engineering Myths<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2f3b36c elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"2f3b36c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Myth 1: Testing is Too Expensive<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3978a4f elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"3978a4f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Reality<\/b>\u00a0\u2212 There is a saying, pay less for testing during software development or pay more for maintenance or correction later.

IEEE defines metric as \u2018a quantitative measure of the degree to which a system, component, or process possesses a given attribute.\u2019 The goal of software metrics is to identify and control essential parameters that affect software development. Other objectives of using software metrics are listed below.<\/p><ul><li>Measuring the size of the software quantitatively.<\/li><li>Assessing the level of complexity involved.<\/li><li>Assessing the strength of the module by measuring coupling.<\/li><li>Assessing the testing techniques.<\/li><li>Specifying when to stop testing.<\/li><li>Determining the date of release of the software.<\/li><li>Estimating cost of resources and project schedule.<\/li><\/ul><p>Software metrics help project managers to gain an insight into the efficiency of the software process, project, and product. This is possible by collecting quality and productivity data and then analyzing and comparing these data with past averages in order to know whether quality improvements have occurred. Also, when metrics are applied in a consistent manner, it helps in project planning and project management activity.

However, it is important to note the differences between them. Measure can be defined as quantitative indication of amount, dimension, capacity, or size of product and process attributes. Measurement can be defined as the process of determining the measure. Metrics can be defined as quantitative measures that allow software engineers to identify the efficiency and improve the quality of software process, project, and product.<\/p><p>To understand the difference, let us consider an example. A measure is established when a number of errors is (single data point) detected in a software component. Measurement is the process of collecting one or more data points. In other words, measurement is established when many components are reviewed and tested individually to collect the measure of a number of errors in all these components. Metrics are associated with individual measure in some manner. That is, metrics are related to detection of errors found per review or the average number of errors found per unit test.<\/p><p>Once measures and metrics have been developed, indicators are obtained. These indicators provide a detailed insight into the software process, software project, or intermediate product. Indicators also enable software engineers or project managers to adjust software processes and improve software products, if required. For example, measurement dashboards or key indicators are used to monitor progress and initiate change. Arranged together, indicators provide snapshots of the system\u2019s performance.<\/p><h2><span id=\"Measured_Data\" class=\"ez-toc-section\"><\/span><strong>Measured Data<\/strong><\/h2><p>Before data is collected and used, it is necessary to know the type of data involved in the software metrics.

For example, consider constructing a building. It is unimaginable that builders go straight to the field and start the construction before detailed designs are established by engineers. In fact, constructing a building without designing it beforehand would be dangerous and the building may have serious issues that could put people&#8217;s lives in danger.<\/p><p>In software engineering, design is one phase of the software development methodology. In fact, it can be claimed that it is the most important phase of the whole process. This is because the entire product will be built upon decisions made in this phase.<\/p><p>Software design is the first step of the software development process. It can be defined as a high-level, technology independent abstraction which describes a system that will be able to accomplish the tasks that were identified in the requirement analysis phase. During this phase, designers will need to make compromises between suggested solutions and available resources. For example, they may have to adopt less efficient solutions due to lack of material or financial resources. Decisions related to the following aspects are made during the design process:<\/p><h3 id=\"section---SystemArchitecture\">System Architecture<\/h3><p>The system architecture defines the relationship between the different pieces (or modules) of the system. Usually, this is presented as a diagram that depicts the relationships and dependencies between the system components. These components are obtained from breaking down the abstract solution (that came from the requirement analysis) into realizable pieces.<\/p><h3 id=\"section---EffortEstimation\">Effort Estimation<\/h3><p>In this step, designers will estimate the amount of work required to finish the work on the design problem. Usually, this is expressed using &#8216;person\/hour&#8217; which allows the designers to map the required effort with the deadlines as well as the financial resources.<\/p><h3 id=\"section---DesignWorkflows\">Design Workflows<\/h3><p>Here designers will use the dependency diagram from the system architecture to decide the order of the different steps to be taken for the development and deployment of the system.<\/p><h3 id=\"section---ToolsAndPlatforms\">Tools and Platforms<\/h3><p>In the design phase, designers should make decisions on the tools and platforms to be used to develop and use the software product. For example, they can decide to use MVC.NET to develop a web application or use LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).<\/p><h3 id=\"section---Interfaces\">Interfaces<\/h3><p>User interfaces should also be designed.

In order to be adept to systematically identify the significant risks which might affect a software project, it is essential to classify risks into different classes. The project manager can then check which risks from each class are relevant to the project.<\/p><p>There are three main classifications of risks which can affect a software project:<\/p><ol class=\"points\"><li>Project risks<\/li><li>Technical risks<\/li><li>Business risks<\/li><\/ol><p><strong>1. Project risks:<\/strong>\u00a0Project risks concern differ forms of budgetary, schedule, personnel, resource, and customer-related problems. A vital project risk is schedule slippage. Since the software is intangible, it is very tough to monitor and control a software project. It is very tough to control something which cannot be identified. For any manufacturing program, such as the manufacturing of cars, the plan executive can recognize the product taking shape.<\/p><p><strong>2. Technical risks:<\/strong>\u00a0Technical risks concern potential method, implementation, interfacing, testing, and maintenance issue. It also consists of an ambiguous specification, incomplete specification, changing specification, technical uncertainty, and technical obsolescence. Most technical risks appear due to the development team&#8217;s insufficient knowledge about the project.<\/p><p><strong>3. Business risks:<\/strong>\u00a0This type of risks contain risks of building an excellent product that no one need, losing budgetary or personnel commitments, etc.<\/p><p class=\"pq\"><strong>Other risk categories<\/strong><\/p><ol class=\"points\"><li><strong>1. Known risks:<\/strong>\u00a0Those risks that can be uncovered after careful assessment of the project program, the business and technical environment in which the plan is being developed, and more reliable data sources (e.g., unrealistic delivery date)<\/li><li><strong>2. Predictable risks:<\/strong>\u00a0Those risks that are hypothesized from previous project experience (e.g., past turnover)<\/li><li><strong>3. Unpredictable risks:<\/strong>\u00a0Those risks that can and do occur, but are extremely tough to identify in advance.<\/li><\/ol><h2 class=\"h2\">Principle of Risk Management<\/h2><div id=\"c286e016-c1b2-41f3-bc12-a274346914ec\" class=\"_ap_apex_ad\" data-section=\"c286e016-c1b2-41f3-bc12-a274346914ec\" data-xpath=\"#city table td:nth-of-type(1) h2:nth-of-type(2)\" data-section-id=\"\" data-render-time=\"1614241711806\" data-ap-network=\"adpTags\"><div id=\"ADP_37780_900X90_c286e016-c1b2-41f3-bc12-a274346914ec\" data-google-query-id=\"CMGL0_7OhO8CFQUh1Qodz6QPxA\"><div id=\"google_ads_iframe_\/103512698\/22100414702_0__container__\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_\/103512698\/22100414702_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_\/103512698\/22100414702_0\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-google-container-id=\"7\" data-load-complete=\"true\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><\/div><\/div><\/div><ol class=\"points\"><li><strong>Global Perspective:<\/strong>\u00a0In this, we review the bigger system description, design, and implementation.
